<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>A real coffee machine doesn't have an infinite supply of water, milk, or coffee beans. And if you input a really big number, it's almost certain that a real coffee machine wouldn't have the supplies needed to make all that coffee for you.</p>
<p>In this stage, you need to improve the previous program. Now you will check amounts of water, milk, and coffee beans available in your coffee machine at the moment.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Write a program that does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>It requests the amounts of water, milk, and coffee beans available at the moment, and then asks for the number of cups a user needs.</li>
<li>If the coffee machine has enough supplies to make the specified amount of coffee, the program should print <code class="java">"Yes, I can make that amount of coffee"</code>.</li>
<li>If the coffee machine can make more than that, the program should output <code class="java">"Yes, I can make that amount of coffee (and even N more than that)"</code>, where <em>N</em> is the number of additional cups of coffee that the coffee machine can make.</li>
<li>If the amount of given resources is not enough to make the specified amount of coffee, the program should output <code class="java">"No, I can make only N cup(s) of coffee"</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like in the previous stage, the coffee machine needs <em>200 ml</em> of water, <em>50 ml</em> of milk, and <em>15 g</em> of coffee beans to make one cup of coffee.</p>
