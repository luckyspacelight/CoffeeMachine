<h2>Hidden enumeration</h2>
<p></p>
<p>You are given a hidden enum named <code class="language-java">Secret</code> with some constants in uppercase.</p>
<p>Write a program that counts and prints how many constants in the enumeration start with <strong>"STAR"</strong>. The enum is accessible during testing.</p>
<p>The small enum for tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// At least two constants start with STAR
enum Secret {
    STAR, CRASH, START, // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>You can uncomment the commented enum and use it as a sample for writing the program. Do not forget you must comment it back before submitting your solution!</p>
<p>Note that at least two constants start with STAR.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
